# Practice Questions

# 1. Take an input from user as an Integer, see if it is even or odd
# user_input = int(input("Enter number : "))
# if user_input % 2 == 0:
#     print("Number is Even !")
# else:
#     print("Number is Odd !")



# 2. Take three inputs from user and print the largest among them
# num = set()
# for x in range(3):
#     user_input = int(input("Enter three numbers :"))
#     num.add(user_input)
# max_num = max(num)
# print(num)
# print("Maximum number from set is :", max_num)



# 3. Making a login system where system asks for username and password, on basis of that it will either give Grant success message or else denied

define_username = "admin12"
define_password = "PAK03*pearl"


user_ask = input("Enter Username :")
pass_ask = input("Enter Password : ")

if user_ask == define_username and pass_ask == define_password:
    print("Grant Access !")
else:
    print("Access Denied")
