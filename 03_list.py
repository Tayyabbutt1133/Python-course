# lists and tuple

name = "harry"
print(name[0])

          #    0     1       2      3      4      5     -->Index
friends = ["Tayyeb", 12, "khalid", True, 12.45, 145.32]

# So there are two ways to get acess of list/array-->friends


# Options one-->access data step by step
print(friends[0])
print(friends[1])
print(friends[2])
print(friends[3])
print(friends[4])
print(friends[5])


# Second option-> Acess all of them once by iterating sort of with loop
# for data in friends:
#     print(data)
